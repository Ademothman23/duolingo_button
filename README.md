# Duolingo Button
## Description
This is a simple script that adds a button to the Duolingo website that allows you to play a sound of the word you are hovering over. It uses the Google Translate API to get the sound file. It also adds a button to the top of the page that allows you to play the sound of the word you are currently learning.
