# Duolingo Button
Hello there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Adem Othman ðŸ¤ª
## Description
This project started as a `Duolingo Button`, then moved on quickly to make some `API` requests from the bored API and display them on the screen.
Next i'll be trying to make it `translate` the text to the language you're learning on Duolingo.

## How to use 
Just click the button... ðŸ¤ª
(i made this just to look cool lol)

## Easter Eggs 
i Shouldn't be telling you this but...
- Type in `Awesome` anywhere... ðŸ¤«
- Turn off internet while on site... ðŸ¥š
- When copying so many times the same text ðŸ¤¯ try to paste it somewhere..

I'll be adding more soon... âœ¨

## Bored API Sample Response
I wanted to add some code in markdown for so long ðŸ˜Ž

```
{
  "activity": "Create a personal website",
  "type": "recreational",
  "participants": 1,
  "price": 0.1,
  "link": "",
  "key": "3141417",
  "accessibility": 0.12
}
```

Time to push this to GitHub ðŸ¤ª
